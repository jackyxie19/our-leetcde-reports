# 服务发现

# [Service Discovery in a Microservices Architecture](https://www.nginx.com/blog/service-discovery-in-a-microservices-architecture/  ) 	

## 为什么使用服务发现？

试想下你需要调用一个REST API或者Thrift API的服务。在请求前你需要知道服务实例的网络地址。传统运行在物理机上的应用，其服务地址相对而言静止不变。偶尔的地址变更可以从配置文件中读取。

然而，现在基于云的微服务应用中定位服务是更加困难的问题。如下图所示：

![Service discovery is difficult in a modern, cloud-based microservices application because the set of instances, and their IP addresses, are subject to constant change](%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%8F%91%E7%8E%B0.assets/Richardson-microservices-part4-1_difficult-service-discovery.png)

服务实例网络地址在动态变更。并且，服务实例的规模也随着自动扩容、失败处理、更新等操作在动态变化。因此，客户端需要一个更精致的服务发现机制。

有两类主要的服务发现模式：[client-side discovery](https://microservices.io/patterns/client-side-discovery.html) ，[server-side discovery](https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html)。

## 客户端服务发现

使用客户端服务发现模式时，客户端负责检测可用服务实例地址，并负载均衡对服务的请求。客户端先查询服务注册中心（可用服务实例数据库），再使用负载均衡算法从可用实例中选取一个服务进行访问。

下图展示了客户端发现模式的结构：

![With client-side service discovery, the client determines the network locations of available service instances and load balances requests across them](%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%8F%91%E7%8E%B0.assets/Richardson-microservices-part4-2_client-side-pattern.png)

服务实例在启动时向服务注册中心注册网络地址，在终结时清除地址项。服务注册项在实例注册后通过心跳机制周期更新。

[Netflix OSS](https://netflix.github.io/) 采用客户端注册发现模式。[Netflix Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) 是其服务注册中心，提供 REST API 提供对服务实例的注册及查询等功能。[Netflix Ribbon](https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon) 是与Eureka交互的IPC客户端，完成对服务实例请求的负载均衡。

客户端服务发现模式有许多优点和缺点。此模式相对简单，除了服务注册中心，没有其他动态变更的部分。同时，因客户端知道所有可用服务实例，其可通过更精致、更符合应用特点的负载均衡策略。此模式最大的缺点是将客户端与服务注册中心功能耦合。必须在客户端为每个编程语言及框架实现服务发现逻辑。

## 服务端服务发现

下图展示了服务端服务发现模式的结构：

![With the server-side service discovery, the load balancer queries a service registry about service locations; clients interact only with the load balancer](%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%8F%91%E7%8E%B0.assets/Richardson-microservices-part4-3_server-side-pattern.png)

客户端将服务请求发送至LOAD BALANCER（负载均衡器）。负载均衡器查询服务注册中心后根据可用服务实例情况将客户端请求路由至对应服务实例。和客户端服务发现模式一样，服务实例向服务注册中心注册及反注册。

[AWS Elastic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) (ELB) 是服务端服务发现的代表。ELB通常用于负载均衡来自互联网的外部请求。但是，也可将ELB用于内部网络的私有请求。客户端通过DNS域名使用HTTP/TCP请求ELB。ELB在注册的Elastic Compute Cloude (EC2)实例或EC2 Container Service (ECS)容器中负载均衡外部请求。ELB中没有单独的服务注册中心，EC2实例及ECS容器向ELB注册及反注册。

使用HTTP实现服务注册中心和负载均衡器的有[NGINX Plus](https://www.nginx.com/products/)，NGINX采用服务端服务发现模式。[blog post](https://www.airpair.com/scalable-architecture-with-docker-consul-and-nginx) 描述了使用[Consul Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) 动态配置NIGIX反向代理。Consul Template是周期性从[Consul service registry](https://www.consul.io/)配置库中生成随机配置文件的工具。无论何时文件发生改变，其会运行一个随机的shell命令。在blog post中展示的示例使用Consul Template生成一个nginx.conf文件，该文件配置了反向代理。之后Consul Template运行NIGIX的重加载配置命令。更精细的云端动态重配置NGINX Puls实现使用[its HTTP API or DNS](https://www.nginx.com/products/on-the-fly-reconfiguration/)。

服务端服务发现模式有许多优点和缺点。最大的优点是该模式服务发现的逻辑从客户端中剥离。客户端只需向负载均衡器发送请求，无需处理服务发现逻辑。然而，此模式也有一些缺点。除非应用部署环境提供了负载均衡器，否则你需要再部署并管理一个高可用系统组件。

## 服务注册中心

服务注册中心是服务发现中的核心部分。它是一个包含服务实例网络地址的数据库。服务注册中心需要高可用且保证数据时效性。客户端可以缓存从服务注册中心获取的网络地址。魂村信息在客户端无法访问时失效。同时，服务注册中心包含使用复制策略保证一致性的集群。

之前提到过的[Netflix Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) 是服务注册中心的很好示例。提供REST API用于服务实例的注册及查询。服务实例使用网络地址通过POST请求注册。每30秒通过PUT请求发送心跳数据更新注册信息。注册信息可通过HTTP发送DELETE请求删除，也会在注册实例超时时清除。客户端可通过HTTP的GET请求获取注册的服务实例。

[Netflix achieves high availability](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Configuring-Eureka-in-AWS-Cloud) by running one or more Eureka servers in each Amazon EC2 availability zone. Each Eureka server runs on an EC2 instance that has an [Elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html). DNS `TEXT` records are used to store the Eureka cluster configuration, which is a map from availability zones to a list of the network locations of Eureka servers. When a Eureka server starts up, it queries DNS to retrieve the Eureka cluster configuration, locates its peers, and assigns itself an unused Elastic IP address.

Eureka clients – services and service clients – query DNS to discover the network locations of Eureka servers. Clients prefer to use a Eureka server in the same availability zone. However, if none is available, the client uses a Eureka server in another availability zone.

其他的实现方式还有[etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd)、[consul](https://www.consul.io/) 、[Apache Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) 、Kuernetes、Marathon等。



Now that we have looked at the concept of a service registry, let’s look at how service instances are registered with the service registry.

## Service Registration Options

As previously mentioned, service instances must be registered with and deregistered from the service registry. There are a couple of different ways to handle the registration and deregistration. One option is for service instances to register themselves, the [self‑registration pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/self-registration.html). The other option is for some other system component to manage the registration of service instances, the [third‑party registration pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/3rd-party-registration.html). Let’s first look at the self‑registration pattern.

### The Self‑Registration Pattern

When using the [self‑registration pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/self-registration.html), a service instance is responsible for registering and deregistering itself with the service registry. Also, if required, a service instance sends heartbeat requests to prevent its registration from expiring. The following diagram shows the structure of this pattern.

![With the self-registration pattern for service discovery, a service instance registers and deregisters itself with the service registry](%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%8F%91%E7%8E%B0.assets/Richardson-microservices-part4-4_self-registration-pattern.png)

A good example of this approach is the [Netflix OSS Eureka client](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka). The Eureka client handles all aspects of service instance registration and deregistration. The [Spring Cloud project](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud), which implements various patterns including service discovery, makes it easy to automatically register a service instance with Eureka. You simply annotate your Java Configuration class with an `@EnableEurekaClient` annotation.

The self‑registration pattern has various benefits and drawbacks. One benefit is that it is relatively simple and doesn’t require any other system components. However, a major drawback is that it couples the service instances to the service registry. You must implement the registration code in each programming language and framework used by your services.

The alternative approach, which decouples services from the service registry, is the third‑party registration pattern.

### The Third‑Party Registration Pattern

When using the [third-party registration pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/3rd-party-registration.html), service instances aren’t responsible for registering themselves with the service registry. Instead, another system component known as the *service registrar* handles the registration. The service registrar tracks changes to the set of running instances by either polling the deployment environment or subscribing to events. When it notices a newly available service instance it registers the instance with the service registry. The service registrar also deregisters terminated service instances. The f

ollowing diagram shows the structure of this pattern.

![With the third-party registration pattern for service discovery, a separate service registrar registers and deregisters service instances with the service registry](%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%8F%91%E7%8E%B0.assets/Richardson-microservices-part4-5_third-party-pattern.png)

One example of a service registrar is the open source [Registrator](https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator) project. It automatically registers and deregisters service instances that are deployed as Docker containers. Registrator supports several service registries, including etcd and Consul.

Another example of a service registrar is [NetflixOSS Prana](https://github.com/netflix/Prana). Primarily intended for services written in non‑JVM languages, it is a sidecar application that runs side by side with a service instance. Prana registers and deregisters the service instance with Netflix Eureka.

The service registrar is a built‑in component of deployment environments. The EC2 instances created by an Autoscaling Group can be automatically registered with an ELB. Kubernetes services are automatically registered and made available for discovery.

The third‑party registration pattern has various benefits and drawbacks. A major benefit is that services are decoupled from the service registry. You don’t need to implement service‑registration logic for each programming language and framework used by your developers. Instead, service instance registration is handled in a centralized manner within a dedicated service.

One drawback of this pattern is that unless it’s built into the deployment environment, it is yet another highly available system component that you need to set up and manage.

## Summary

In a microservices application, the set of running service instances changes dynamically. Instances have dynamically assigned network locations. Consequently, in order for a client to make a request to a service it must use a service‑discovery mechanism.

A key part of service discovery is the [service registry](https://microservices.io/patterns/service-registry.html). The service registry is a database of available service instances. The service registry provides a management API and a query API. Service instances are registered with and deregistered from the service registry using the management API. The query API is used by system components to discover available service instances.

There are two main service‑discovery patterns: client-side discovery and service-side discovery. In systems that use [client‑side service discovery](https://microservices.io/patterns/client-side-discovery.html), clients query the service registry, select an available instance, and make a request. In systems that use [server‑side discovery](https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html), clients make requests via a router, which queries the service registry and forwards the request to an available instance.

There are two main ways that service instances are registered with and deregistered from the service registry. One option is for service instances to register themselves with the service registry, the [self‑registration pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/self-registration.html). The other option is for some other system component to handle the registration and deregistration on behalf of the service, the [third‑party registration pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/3rd-party-registration.html).

In some deployment environments you need to set up your own service‑discovery infrastructure using a service registry such as [Netflix Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka), [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd), or [Apache Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/). In other deployment environments, service discovery is built in. For example, [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/architectural-roadmap.md) and [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/service-discovery-load-balancing.html) handle service instance registration and deregistration. They also run a proxy on each cluster host that plays the role of [server‑side discovery](https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html) router.

An HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer such as NGINX can also be used as a server‑side discovery load balancer. The service registry can push the routing information to NGINX and invoke a graceful configuration update; for example, you can use [Consul Template](https://hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-consul-template.html). NGINX Plus supports [additional dynamic reconfiguration mechanisms](https://www.nginx.com/products/on-the-fly-reconfiguration/) – it can pull information about service instances from the registry using DNS, and it provides an API for remote reconfiguration.
